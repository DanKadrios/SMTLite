# SMT-lite Refactoring Summary

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Goal**: Improve code maintainability, readability, and testability without changing gameplay behavior.

## Changes Made

### `src/engine.js`
**Refactored for clarity and documentation**

- **Added JSDoc comments** for all public functions and the Actor class
- **Extracted helper**: `resolveAffinity(attackElement, defender)` 
  - Centralized affinity multiplier logic
  - Kept `getMultiplier()` as backwards-compatible alias
- **Enhanced `damage()` function**:
  - Now accepts either (power, element) or a skill object
  - Clearer variable names (`resolvedPower`, `resolvedElement`)
  - Separated damage computation into logical steps
- **Improved `aiChooseMove()`**:
  - Added explicit normalization of skill entries
  - Clearer iteration logic for finding highest-power skill
  - Better handling of edge cases (null, string keys, objects)
- **Formatted `runPassiveEvent()`** for readability (no logic changes)

**API preserved**: All exports remain the same (Actor, damage, aiChooseMove, applyPassiveEffects, runPassiveEvent)

### `src/main.js`
**Refactored for maintainability and performance**

- **DOM Caching**: `cacheDOM()` function stores all frequently-accessed elements in a `dom` object
  - Eliminates repeated `getElementById()` calls
  - Makes code easier to read and maintain
  
- **Helper Functions**:
  - `resolveSkill(key)`: Centralized skill keyâ†’object resolution with safe fallback
  - `log(msg, type)`: Typed logging ('player', 'enemy', 'info') with color coding
  - `setMovesEnabled(enabled)`: Unified move button enable/disable with MP checking
  - `renderPlayerMoves()`: Dedicated function to create player move buttons
  - `renderEnemyMoves()`: Dedicated function to render enemy move list
  
- **Simplified `updateUI()`**:
  - Uses cached DOM references
  - Calls focused render helpers
  - Much easier to read and debug
  
- **Improved `startBattle()`**:
  - Clearer flow and better comments
  - Uses new render helpers
  
- **Enhanced `playerAction()`**:
  - Better structured with clear phases
  - More readable conditionals
  - Better variable names (`eskills`, `aires`)

- **Cleaner initialization**: `DOMContentLoaded` handler uses cached DOM and is more readable

**Behavior preserved**: All gameplay mechanics work exactly as before

## Benefits

1. **Easier to maintain**: Functions are smaller, focused, and well-documented
2. **Better performance**: DOM caching reduces query overhead
3. **More testable**: Helper functions can be unit-tested in isolation
4. **Easier to extend**: Adding new features (like more physical skills) is now straightforward
5. **Improved readability**: Code is self-documenting with clear function names and JSDoc

## Next Steps

Consider:
- Adding unit tests for `resolveSkill()`, `resolveAffinity()`, and damage calculation
- Populating `src/moves.js` with the full physical skills list from SMT V
- Extracting constants (element names, colors) into a config file
- Adding TypeScript definitions for better IDE support
