SMT-lite Battle Simulator

Open `main.html` in a browser to run a simple prototype of a Shin Megami Tensei style battle.

This is intentionally minimal: simple actor stats, skill list, and a naive AI. Next steps:
- Add elemental affinities and weaknesses
- Add skill targeting and MP
- Add status effects, resistances, and critical hits
- Add animation and nicer UI
